# Resume-Site

Hello, My name is Michael Rodriguez.

I have created this site to showcase my work and have it all easlisy available to potential employers and clients. This consist of two pages: Home page and Portfolio page. 

This site will be updated periodically as I continue to expand on my skills.

What you can find in use:
*GitHub - Repository for this site and all other work
*Bootstrap - Responsive CSS style, some manual styling is also set
*Favicon - makes the tab look cool
*Contact and Resume information


Todo list:
*API - Add something using an API, most likely using the API to pull my own profile data and display this here. Possibly my references and job experinece.
