I tested it with noth the boostrap page (it works there) and regular code (no modifications) but still no luck on my page. Good news is the button appears when it is supposed to when you shrink the page, so that is a plus.   -->
        <!-- Later I realize that the navbar is within the containter to keep the size of the main content. I was being dumb and included the header and footer thinking that the instructions called for that. So now the header and footer are out of the container -->

                    <p>I am a dedicated individual that strives for excellence and have always had a strong desire to
                        excel in any endeavor. Goals are reached with a well planned and executed process, completing
                        all tasks correctly the first time with lasting results. The ideal atmosphere is one that
                        support integrity, honesty and organization. As my background is in the ever-changing
                        Information Technology field, my success is credited to my ability of adaption and applying the
                        fundamentals of learning to every situation, I grow in everything that I do.</p>

                    <p>I have been in the IT industry for 12 years and couting. My background compiles of: hardware
                        support, software support, systems administration, project management, vendor / account
                        management and more. I have learned a lot with each experience and there is no shortage of
                        things to learn. There is also a level of adaptation necessary with this industry as everything
                        varies per industry, per company, per team.</p>

                    <p>This year I decided to invest in my education with coding. Currently I am working University of
                        Denver with a Coding BootCamp. I can say from my experience thus far I would probably be a
                        better Back End Developer but I am still aiming to be a full stack developer.</p>
